# The LaTeX class `adelaide-mecheng-thesis`

## Installation and first use

* If you're on a personal computer, first install a LaTeX distribution such as MiKTeX (Windows), MacTeX (Mac), or TeX Live (all platforms).
* Download the three files above by clicking on the ‘Download ZIP’ button on the right.
* Open `adelaide-mecheng-thesis.dtx` in TeXWorks or your favourite LaTeX editor and compile it. This will produce the PDF documentation and also create the necessary class file (`adelaide-mecheng-thesis.cls`).
* Now open `example.tex` and try compiling it; if everything is installed correctly you should end up with a sensible looking PDF.
* Edit the `example.bib` file using JabRef or similar; take some time to ensure that your own bibliography is carefully put together.
