	Abstract = {Hurling is one of the fastest and most skilful field games in the world. Its popularity in recent years has reached exceptional proportions with interest in the game spreading far beyond Ireland to America and the Far East. The promotion and commercialization of the game through television and the print media has brought the game in line with other major sporting games of the world. However, the equipment used in playing the game has not changed much in the last 50 years. The two most important pieces of equipment being the hurley, the stick used to strike the ball, and the ball itself which is known as the sliotar. The objective of this research is to determine some of the physical and mechanical characteristics of an ash hurley and also to establish tests which could be used to establish a standard for the sliotar. In Ireland, ash is the traditional wood used for the manufacture of the hurley. The genus Fraxinus consists of about 65 species mainly found in temperate latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Only one is native to Ireland, the common ash, Fraxinus excelsior L. Ash is a strong, springy timber and it is used in the manufacture of furniture, tool handles and sports goods. The conventional sliotar or hurling ball consists of a spherical cork centre which is wrapped with up to five different types of yarn. A leather skin is hand stitched over this core and finally the ball is buffed and blackened. These final steps give the ball its unique surface ribs.},

	Abstract = {A companion paper has treated computer simulation of javelin flight using measured lift, drag and pitching moments. In the present paper we present, categorize and discuss the relative significance of varicus initial conditions in such a simulation. Since the differential equations describing flight are autonomous, the eventual javelin range and entry angle are unique functions of the initial conditions. A series of successively less constrained optimum solutions is defined, the last of which is the global optimum javelin trajectory. Sensitivities of these trajectories to perturbations from the optima and their implications for throwers are discussed. Finally, we investigate the effects of some design and environmental parameters on optimal initial conditions and trajectories.},
